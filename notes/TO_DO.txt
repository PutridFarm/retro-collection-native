TO DO:
 1. ENUM to specify console types. Dynamic routing through console
 2. Utils library for reads/common functions
 3. Lazy load text when selecting game. Avoid reading too much information on console page load.
    In Content.updateContent(), read the items text and other heavy attributes (picture...etc)

    Thinking of setting up read functions that lazy load all attributes passed in.
    Might be a little overkill for this project but might be worth looking into at some point

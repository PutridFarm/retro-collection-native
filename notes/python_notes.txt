Running a main python script in PyCharm:

You just need to do this.

Create a Python file on crawler folder on your project. I used main.py.

Project
  Crawler
    Crawler
      Spiders
      ...
    main.py
    scrapy.cfg
Inside your main.py put this code below.

from scrapy import cmdline
cmdline.execute("scrapy crawl spider".split())
And you need to create a "Run Configuration" to run your main.py.

Doing this, if you put a breakpoint at your code it will stop there.
